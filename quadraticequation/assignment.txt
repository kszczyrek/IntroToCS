Write a program that reads three real numbers: a, b, and c, then solves the quadratic equation:

a * x^2 + b * x + c = 0

Use a floating-point type for the calculations and ensure proper input and output formatting for real numbers. Additionally, include the necessary mathematical library to use the square root function.

When compiling the program, make sure to link the required math library.

The program should:
- Print a message indicating that there is no real solution if the equation has no real roots.
- Display a single solution if the discriminant (Î”) is zero.
- Print two distinct solutions if the discriminant is positive.
