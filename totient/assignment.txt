reate a library containing the following function:

- `unsigned totient(unsigned n)`: Returns the count of numbers less than or equal to `n` that are relatively prime to `n`.  

Use the previously implemented algorithm for prime factorization.  

Then, write a main program that reads a sequence of numbers from the command line arguments and prints the corresponding results.  

Example usage of the compiled program: 
$ ./program 1 11 100 5000 12345678

 totient(1) = 1
 totient(11) = 10
 totient(100) = 40
 totient(5000) = 2000
 totient(12345678) = 4027392
